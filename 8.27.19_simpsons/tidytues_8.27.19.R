# Tidy Tuesday - 8.27.2019 - Simpsons

## Notes 
# to make a new folder directly in terminal : "  mkdir 8_27_19  "

# commit is like saving instantaneously commit often; push occasionally 
# can revert to go back to most recently commited version

# rule of thumb - when working with collaborators make sure to pull once per day and be careful about pushing to avoid conflicting copies
